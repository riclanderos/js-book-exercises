/* Exercise-1
Write a program named greeter.js that greets 'Victor' three times. Your 
program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor' 
in each greeting. Here's an example run of the program: */

let firstName = "Victor";
console.log("Good Morning, " + firstName + ".");
console.log("Good Afternoon, " + firstName + ".");
console.log("Good Evening, " + firstName + ".");

/* Practice doing it with for loop

let timeOfDay = ["Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"];
for (i = 2; i < timeOfDay.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay[0]}, ${firstName}.`);
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay[1]}, ${firstName}.`);
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay[2]}, ${firstName}.`);
} */
